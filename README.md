# UI Testing: stubbing the network
Source code for my "UI Testing: stubbing the network" workshop at the [2020 try Swift! World conference](https://www.tryswift.co/world/#).

* The `master` branch is the starting point for the workshop.
* The `protocols` branch stubs the network via fakes and protocols.
* The `swifter` branch mocks the network via a HTTP server.

After cloning this repository you can start a server to host the JSON file.

```
$ python3 -m http.server
```
